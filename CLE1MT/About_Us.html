                        <p><b>Shannon Alyson M. Po</b> is an undergraduate at the University of St. La Salle (USLS) - Bacolod pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Information Technology.</p>
                        <p>She has always found the landscapes, wildlife, and vegetation of the Philippines to be beautiful. However, as time passed, pollution kept rapidly affecting the environment to the point where most indigenous species have become endangered and even extinct.</p>
                        <p>As an IT student, she hopes to use the knowledge and skills she will learn to create a program that can help solve the problem of pollution in the Philippines. Her particular focus is on the education and strict implementation of proper waste disposal, planting trees, cleaning the oceans, and promoting renewable energy.</p>
