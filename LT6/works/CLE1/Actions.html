                        <h2>Organizations' Actions Against Pollution</h2>
                        <p><b>Greenpeace Philippines</b>'s main goal is to protect natural landscapes, species, and more from environmental threats such as perilous waste imports, coal projects, and illegal logging. Aside from promoting ecological farming, this volunteer-based group also holds campaigns against land, air, and water pollution.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>Healthcare for Clean Air Alliance</b>, aims to highlight the health impacts of air pollution by pushing for the strict implementation of laws against air pollutants and helping improve the country's air-quality monitoring standards.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>Philippine College of Physicians' Advocacy Committee on Climate Change</b> has recently started working with the government to improve education in the health sector and among the public of the problem. They want to identify the local sources of air pollution and increase the awareness of its existence, intensify campaigns for alternative clean sources of energy, encourage the active involvement of health people and agencies, strengthen organizations working on pollution issues and, finally, urging the government to strengthen and implement existing laws regulating air pollution.</p>

                        <h2>Individual Actions that can Help Reduce Pollution</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>Using public transports</b><br>Using public transport is a sure short way of contributing to less air pollution as it provides with less gas and energy, even carpools contribute to it. In addition to less release of fuels and gas, using a public transport can also help in saving money.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>Turn off the lights when not in use</b><br>The energy that the lights take also contribute to air pollution, thus less consumption of electricity can save energy. Use energy saving fluorescent lights to help the environment.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>Recycle and Reuse</b><br>The concept of recycle and reuse is not just conserve resources and use them judicially but also is helpful for air pollution as it helps in reducing pollution emissions. The recycled products also take less power to make other products.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>No to plastic bags</b><br>The use of plastic products could be very harmful to the environment as they take a very long time to decompose, due to their material made up of oil. The use of paper bags instead is a better alternative as they decompose easily and are recyclable.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>Use of fans instead of Air Conditioner</b><br>The usage of AC's takes a lot of energy and emits a lot of heat which is bad for the environment. AC's also take a lot of power and energy to work as compared to fans.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>Stop buying products that use single-use plastic</b><br>Single-use plastics takes up the most of our country's garbage. Try to buy products in bulk to reduce your use of plastic.</p>
